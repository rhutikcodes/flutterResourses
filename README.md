# Flutter Resourses

The official Flutter Developer Youtube series created by the Google Flutter team.
## [Build Native Mobile Apps with Flutter](https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905)
This is a free Udacity course created by the Google Flutter team.
## [Flutter Docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs)
While I can't recommend most docs as a learning resource, I would make an exception for the Flutter Docs. They are really great not just as a reference but as a study aid. I especially recommend the Codelabs.

A live, animated reference of Flutter Widges
